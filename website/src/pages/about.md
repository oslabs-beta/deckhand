# About Us

Deckhand is an open source product supported by 501(c)(3) nonprofit tech accelerator [OSLabs](https://www.opensourcelabs.io/).

Our mission is to advance open source innovation by supporting engineering leaders that are dedicated to building products that will benefit the software engineering community and the tech industry as a whole.

We believe that open source software is essential to the infrastructure of modern technology. Nearly all software today relies on free, public code, written and maintained by communities of developers. We seek to drive innovation, transparency, and collaboration between open source developers and their users.

OSLabs is devoted to furthering high-impact open source software within a collaborative community of dedicated engineers and mentors. By doing so, we advance open source innovation as well as the education and careers of software developers.
