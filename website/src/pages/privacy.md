**Effective Date:** October 6, 2023

This Privacy Policy applies to Deckhand ("we", "us", or "our"), an open-source application. Your privacy is critically important to us, and we are committed to protecting the personal information you share with us. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect from users, how we use it, and the steps we take to protect it.

## 1. Information Collection

We collect information from users in the following ways:

- **GitHub Integration:** When you connect your GitHub account, we access your GitHub ID, avatar, name, email address, and private repositories. We use OAuth for authentication and do not store your GitHub password.
- **AWS Credentials:** You may provide us with your AWS credentials to enable certain features within the app. We use this information solely for the purposes of the functionality provided by the app and do not store these credentials longer than necessary.
- **User Inputs:** We may collect additional information through user inputs or actions within the app.
- **Automatically Collected Data:** We automatically collect certain types of data when you interact with our app, such as your IP address, device information, and usage statistics.

## 2. Use of Information

We use the information collected for several purposes:

- To provide, maintain, and improve the functionality of the app.
- To communicate with you, if necessary, about your use of the app.
- To comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## 3. Information Sharing

We may share your information with third parties in the following circumstances:

- **Service Providers:** We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our service (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, marketing, and development). These third parties have access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
- **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).
- **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your personal information may be transferred.

## 4. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We implement appropriate data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information.

## 5. International Transfer

Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those from your jurisdiction.
