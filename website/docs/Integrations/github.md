# GitHub

GitHub is required to search, build, and deploy your Git repositories into Kubernetes pods. It is also how you log into Deckhand.

If you haven't already, first create GitHub account. Then, from the Deckhand login page, click "Log in with GitHub". This will redirect you to GitHub to authorize Deckhand to access your account and repositories. Click "Authoize Deckhand". This will redirect you back to the Deckhand app and log in.
