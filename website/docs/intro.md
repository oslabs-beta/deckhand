# Introduction

<img align="right" src="/img/ship-character.png" width="300" />

Ahoy! And welcome to the exciting world of Kubernetes. I'm your Deckhand.

I'll help you deploy a Kubernetes cluster with no code. Fully automated. Open source.

### Simple to use

Visual drag and drop interface lets you virtually craft your system design, so you can focus on what matters and automate the rest.

### Connect any software

Instantly search for and connect any commercial or open source software, including your private Github repositories, and deploy it with a click.

### No vendor lock-in

We'll deploy directly to your linked cloud provider, so you can involve Deckhand as much or as little as you'd like, and take back the wheel at any time.
